In this project, I created several data frames analyzing data collected for public and charter schools. First, I summarized the data of the entire district, then by school, with the top and bottom performing schools following. Math scores and reading scores were then summarized on their own. Lastly, scores were grouped by spending, school size and type. I included some observations about the data at the top of my notebook and also below. 

Data Observations: 
To me, the most informative data frames in this assignment are at the end of the analysis. It is clear that students at charter schools have the highest average grades in this data set. It is interesting that as spending range and school size increase, % passing of math and reading decrease. I would be curious to study that trend further.
