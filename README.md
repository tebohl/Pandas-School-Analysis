In this assignment, I created several data frames according to the instructions provided. First summarizing the data of the entire district, then by school, with the top and bottom perforing schools following. Math scores and reading scores were then summarized on their own. Lastly, scores were grouped by spending, school size and type. I included some observations about the data at the top of my notebook. I was able to format most of the data that needed dollar signs and commas, except for the Per Student Budget. After formatting, this column was converted into objects which then caused errors in the data frames that required these values as float later on in the analysis.
